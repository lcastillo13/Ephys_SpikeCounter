Python code that filters raw ephys data above a certain voltage threshold. Code can be used to eliminate spikes that did not meet threshold (background noise) or include spikes that were above a certain threshold (action potential). Code can be adjusted to different threshholds to allow for the filtering of different intensity action potentials.
